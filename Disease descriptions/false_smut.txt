False Smut (Noda Palsu/Gosong Palsu)
Latin name: Ustilaginoidea virens

False smut causes chalkiness of grains which leads to reduction in grain weight. It also reduces seed germination

The disease can occur in areas with high relative humidity (>90%) and temperature ranging from 25-35 C.  
Rain, high humidity, and soils with high nitrogen content also favors disease development. Wind can spread the fungal spores from plant to plant.
False smut is visible only after panicle exsertion. It can infect the plant during flowering stage.
