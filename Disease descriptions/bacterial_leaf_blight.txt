Bacterial leaf blight (BLB-Kresek Hawar Daun)
Latin name: Xanthomonas campestris pv. Oryzae

It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves.

The disease is most likely to develop in areas that have weeds and stubbles of infected plants. It can occur in both tropical and temperate environments, particularly in irrigated and rainfed lowland areas. In general, the disease favors temperatures at 25-34 C, with relative humidity above 70%.
It is commonly observed when strong winds and continuous heavy rains occur, allowing the disease-causing bacteria to easily spread through ooze droplets on lesions of infected plants.
Bacterial blight can be severe in susceptible rice varieties under high nitrogen fertilization.
