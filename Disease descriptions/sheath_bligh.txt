Sheath Bligh (Hawar Pelepah ), Sheath Blight (Hawar Upih Daun) and Stem Rot (Busuk Batang)
Latin name: Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn

Infected leaves senesce or dry out and die more rapidly, young tillers can also be destroyed.
As a result, the leaf area of the canopy can significantly be reduced by the disease. This reduction in leaf area, along with the diseased-induced senescence of leaves and young infected tillers are the primary causes of yield reduction.

Sheath blight occurs in areas with high temperature (28-32C),  high levels of nitrogen fertilizer, and relative humidity of crop canopy from 85âˆ’100%.
Plants are more vulnerable to sheath blight during the rainy season.
High seeding rate or close plant spacing, dense canopy, disease in the soil, sclerotia or infection bodies floating on the water, and growing of high yielding improved varieties also favor disease development.
