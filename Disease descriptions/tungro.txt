Tungro
Latin name: Tungro

Rice tungro disease is caused by the combination of two viruses, which are transmitted by leafhoppers. It causes leaf discoloration, stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains.
Tungro infects cultivated rice, some wild rice relatives and other grassy weeds commonly found in rice paddies.

Tungro disease viruses are transmitted from one plant to another by leafhoppers that feed on tungro-infected plants. The most efficient vector is the green leafhopper.
Leafhoppers can acquire the viruses from any part of the infected plant by feeding on it, even for a short time. It can, then, immediately transmit the viruses to other plants within 5−7 days. The viruses do not remain in the leafhopper's body unless it feeds again on an infected plant and re-acquires the viruses.
Tungro infection can occur during all growth stages of the rice plant. It is most frequently seen during the vegetative phase. Plants are most vulnerable at tillering stage.

Tungro incidence depends on the availability of the virus sources and vector population. Other than infected rice plants in the farmer's field, other primary sources for tungro, include:
1. stubble of previous crops
2. new growth from infected stubbles that had not been properly plowed under and harrowed effectively
3. volunteer rice
4. infected plants in nearby rice fields

Seedlings raised in nurseries or seedbeds can also be infected with Tungro prior to transplanting and can be a primary source of virus.
Transplanting seedlings from nurseries in tungro-infected areas has also shown to increase infection rates in the field, particularly, in cases where seedbed is in a tungro-endemic area or when the nursery duration is 5−6 weeks.
However, this is not believed to be a very strong mechanism in initiating epidemics, because the competitiveness of tungro-infected seedlings is low; they can die rapidly after transplanting.
