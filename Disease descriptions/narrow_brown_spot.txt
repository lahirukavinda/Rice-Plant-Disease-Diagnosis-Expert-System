Narrow Brown Spot (Bercak Coklat Sempit)
Latin name : Cercospora oryzae

It leads to premature death of leaves and leaf sheaths, premature ripening of grains, and in severe cases, lodging of plants.

Narrow brown spot has been reported from rice-growing regions in the tropics and subtropics of Asia, Africa, Australia, and North, Central, and South America and Papua New Guinea.
The disease usually occurs in potassium deficient soils, and in areas with temperature ranging from 25-28C.
It appears during the late growth stages of the rice crop, starting at heading stage.
Plants are most susceptible during panicle initiation onwards, and damage becomes more severe as plants approach maturity.
