Grassy Stunt (Kerdil Rumput)
Latin name: Nilaparvata Lugens Stal

Rice grassy stunt virus reduces yields by inhibiting panicle production.

Rice grassy stunt virus affects rice crops in areas where continuous and year-round rice growing is practiced.
The virus is transmitted between plants by insect vectors. Nymph and adult stage plant hoppers are common vectors for rice grassy stunt virus. The plant hoppers need to feed on an infected plant for at least 30 minutes to pick-up the virus.
Plants can be infected at all growth stages. They are most vulnerable to infection at the tillering stage. Rice grassy stunt virus symptoms develop 10-12 days after infection. Infected stubble and volunteer rice are sources of rice grassy stunt virus. It cannot be transmitted via brown planthopper eggs.
