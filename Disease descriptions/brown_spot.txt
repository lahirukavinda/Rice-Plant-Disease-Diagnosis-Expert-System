Brown Spot (Bercak Coklat)
Latin name: Helminthosporium oryzae /Drechslera oryzae

Brown spot has been historically largely ignored as one of the most common and most damaging rice diseases.
Its most observable damage is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf. When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed. 

The disease can develop in areas with high relative humidity (86−100%) and temperature between 16 and 36 C. It is common in unflooded and nutrient-deficient soil, or in soils that accumulate toxic substances. 

For infection to occur, the leaves must be wet for 8−24 hours.

The fungus can survive in the seed for more than four years and can spread from plant to plant through air. Major sources of brown spot in the field include:

1. infected seed, which give rise to infected seedlings
2. volunteer rice
3. infected rice debris
4. weeds

Brown spot can occur at all crop stages, but the infection is most critical during maximum tillering up to the ripening stages of the crop.
