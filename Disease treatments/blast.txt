The primary control option for blast is to plant resistant varieties. Contact your local agriculture office for up-to-date lists of varieties available.

Other crop management measures can also be done, such as:

1. Adjust planting time. Sow seeds early, when possible, after the onset of the rainy season.
2. Split nitrogen fertilizer application in two or more treatments. Excessive use of fertilizer can increase blast intensity.
3. Flood the field as often as possible.

Silicon fertilizers (e.g., calcium silicate) can be applied to soils that are silicon deficient to reduce blast. However, because of its high cost, silicon should be applied efficiently. Cheap sources of silicon, such as straws of rice genotypes with high silicon content, can be an alternative. Care should be taken to ensure that the straw is free from blast as the fungus can survive on rice straw and the use of infected straw as a silicon source can spread the disease further.
Systemic fungicides like triazoles and strobilurins can be used judiciously for control to control blast. A fungicide application at heading can be effective in controlling the disease.
