There is currently no resistant rice variety available for cultivation. The main management options available to minimize sheath blight include:

1. use a reasonable level of fertilizer adapted to the cropping season.
2. use reasoned density of crop establishment (direct seeding or transplanting).
3. carefully control of weeds, especially on the levees.
4. drain rice fields relatively early in the cropping season to reduce sheath blight epidemics.
5. use fungicide to treat seeds.
6. improve canopy architecture by reducing seeding rate or providing wider plant spacing.
