Once a rice plant is infected by tungro, it cannot be cured.
Preventive measures are more effective for the control of tungro than direct disease control measures. Using insecticides to control leafhoppers is often not effective, because green leafhoppers continuously move to surrounding fields and spread tungro rapidly in very short feeding times.

The most practical measures at present, include

1. Grow tungro or leafhopper resistant varieties. This is the most economical means of managing the disease. There are tungro-resistant varieties available for the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh. 
Contact your local agriculture office for up-to-date lists of varieties available.
2. Practice synchronous planting with surrounding farms. Delayed or late planting, relative to the average date in a given area, makes the field susceptible for Tungro. Late-planted fields also pose a risk to early planting in the next season.
3. Adjust planting times to when green leafhopper are not in season or abundant, if known
4. Plow infected stubbles immediately after harvest to reduce inoculum sources and destroy the eggs and breeding sites of green leaf hopper.
