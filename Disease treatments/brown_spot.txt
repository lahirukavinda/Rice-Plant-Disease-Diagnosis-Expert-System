Improving soil fertility is the first step in managing brown spot. To do this:

1. monitor soil nutrients regularly
2. apply required fertilizers
3. for soils that are low in silicon, apply calcium silicate slag before planting

Fertilizers, however, can be costly and may take many cropping seasons before becoming effective. More economical management options include:

1. Use resistant varieties. Contact your local agriculture office for up-to-date lists of varieties available.
2. Use fungicides (e.g., iprodione, propiconazole, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, and carbendazim) as seed treatments.
3. Treat seeds with hot water (53-54C) for 10-12 minutes before planting, to control primary infection at the seedling stage. To increase effectiveness of treatment, pre-soak seeds in cold water for eight hours.
