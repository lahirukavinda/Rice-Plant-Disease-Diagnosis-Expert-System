Planting resistant varieties has been proven to be the most efficient, most reliable, and cheapest way to control bacterial blight.

Other disease control options include:

1. Use balanced amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen.
2. Ensure good drainage of fields (in conventionally flooded crops) and nurseries.
3. Keep fields clean. Remove weed hosts and plow under rice stubble, straw, rice ratoons and volunteer seedlings, which can serve as hosts of bacteria.
4. Allow fallow fields to dry in order to suppress disease agents in the soil and plant residues.
